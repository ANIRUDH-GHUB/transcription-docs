00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.268
Welcome The Thoughts on the market.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8465902

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.083
I'm Michael Jesus,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8465902

00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:06.709
Head of Global Thematic and Public

NOTE Confidence: 0.8465902

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:08.300
Policy Research for Morgan Stanley.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8465902

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.740
Along with my colleagues bringing

NOTE Confidence: 0.8465902

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.180
you a variety of perspectives,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8465902

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.510
I'll be talking about the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8465902

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.308
intersection between public

NOTE Confidence: 0.8465902

00:00:13.308 --> 00:00:14.640
policy and financial markets.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8465902

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.214
It's Thursday,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8465902

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:18.790
November 10th at 3:00 PM in New York.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.476
It's nearly two full days after

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:20.476 --> 00:00:21.600
polls closed across America,

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.286
and we still don't know which

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:23.286 --> 00:00:24.410
party will control Congress.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.433
But for investors, we very likely know

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:28.628
all we need to know at this point.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.470
Let me explain.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.870
It may take several days,

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.275
maybe weeks, to determine which

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:32.275 --> 00:00:33.680
party will control the Senate.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.050
But knowing which party controls

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.751
the Senate won't matter much if

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:38.166
Republicans gain a majority in

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.298
the House of Representatives,

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.705
as they appear likely to

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:42.110
do as of this recording,

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.322
That's because Republicans controlling

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:45.426
at least one Chamber of Congress is

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:45.426 --> 00:00:46.884
enough to yield a divided government,

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.350
meaning that the party in

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.810
control of the White House.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.574
That also in control of Congress

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:51.574 --> 00:00:52.750
and so can't unilaterally

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:52.807 --> 00:00:54.227
choose its legislative path.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.178
For bond markets,

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:55.178 --> 00:00:57.074
this is a mostly friendly outcome.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.068
It takes off the table the scenario

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:00:59.068 --> 00:01:00.929
that could have led to fiscal

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:02.831
policy from Congress that would cut

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:04.659
against the Fed's inflation goals.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.907
That scenario would have been one more

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:06.907 --> 00:01:08.835
Democrats keep control of the House

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:10.350
and expand their Senate Majority.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.880
That outcome might have suggested

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.782
inflation was less a political and

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:15.062
electoral concern than previously

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:15.062 --> 00:01:17.029
thought and through a broader Senate

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:18.895
Majority given Democrats more rude to

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:20.430
legislate if markets perceived that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.930
Combination of a willingness and

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.454
ability to legislate is increasing

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:23.454 --> 00:01:24.889
the probability of enacting spending

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:26.570
measures like a child tax credit

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.598
that would support aggregate

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:27.598 --> 00:01:28.910
demand in the US economy.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.530
Then investors would also have to

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.525
price in the possibility of a higher

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.230
than expected peak Fed funds rate,

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.350
pushing Treasury yields higher.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.910
Of course,

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.856
this appears not to be what happened.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.988
So the bottom line the election outcome

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:39.988 --> 00:01:42.039
is important and still up in the air,

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.280
but markets may know enough to move on.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.111
Thanks for listening.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90059274

00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:45.388
